# Health Cleo v2: AI-Powered Personalized Nutrition Intelligence

## Our 3-Day Innovation Sprint [27 - 30 Sept]

### Day 1: Redefining the Problem
We realized that existing solutions, while helpful, weren't truly personalizing nutrition advice. Our goal: to create a system that understands the complex interplay between individual health data, food choices, and long-term outcomes.

### Day 2: Conceptualizing Causal and Inference Graphs
We introduced two game-changing concepts:
1. Causal Graphs: To map the relationships between food consumption and health effects.
2. Inference Graphs: To model the decision-making process for food safety.

These graphs allow us to provide truly personalized, explainable nutrition advice.

### Day 3: Integration and Testing
We integrated Upstage's powerful LLM capabilities with our custom graph generation algorithms. We also incorporated external APIs (Nutritionix, OpenFoodFacts, Tavily) for comprehensive data analysis.

## Key Features

- Dynamic causal and inference graph generation
- Real-time food analysis with personalized recommendations
- Integration of individual health data with population-level insights
- Multilingual support for global users
